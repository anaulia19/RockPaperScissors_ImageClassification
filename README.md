# RockPaperScissors_ImageClassification
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of hand gestures for rock, paper, and scissors, as part of a Dicoding assignment. The model is trained on a dataset and can predict gestures in new images, showcasing practical deep learning for image classification.
